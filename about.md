Hi! My name is **Christopher Ton** and I am an aspiring data scientist/analyst from San Jose, CA.

I'm passionate about the practical applications of data, using the insights gained to drive better informed decisions about the world. 

I have experiences competing in hackathons and case competitions that involved stirring up a solution for the community using data provided by local sponsors. I've built analytical project and award winning visualization dashboards that have addressed homelessness, sports, energy usage and COVID-19.

For fun, I enjoy working on side projects and getting involved with the open source community about new tools and technologies around Python/R.
