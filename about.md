Hi! My name is **Christopher Ton** and I am an aspiring data scientist/analyst from San Jose, CA. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in data analytics from SJSU while working as a Data Annotation Specialist at Tesla.

I'm passionate about the practical applications of data, using the insights gained to drive better-informed decisions about the world. 

I have experience competing in hackathons and case competitions that involved stirring up a solution for the community using data provided by local sponsors. I've built analytical projects and award-winning visualization dashboards that have addressed homelessness, sports, energy usage, and COVID-19.

For fun, I enjoy working on side projects and getting involved with the open-source community about new tools and technologies around Python/R. 

Feel free to connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriztopherton/)!

My resume is available to [view](https://github.com/chriztopherton/chriztopherton.github.io/blob/master/assets/Christopher_Ton_Resume.pdf)
